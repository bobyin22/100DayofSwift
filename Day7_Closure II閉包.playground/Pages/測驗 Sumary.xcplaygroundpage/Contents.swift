//Which of these are true about closures?
//
//Hint: Closures can accept parameters and return values, just like regular functions.
//1️⃣

//
//✅Option 1: If you use external values in your closure they will be captured.
//This is called closure capturing.
//
//Option 2: You can't create arrays of closures.
//You can do this just fine.
//2️⃣
//Option 1: Closures must always return boolean true or false.
//They can return whatever you need them to return.
//
//✅Option 2: Swift provides shorthand parameter names like $0 and $1
//There can potentially be any number of these, but usually anything past $2 is too hard to remember.

//3️⃣
//✅Option 1: If the last parameter to a function is a closure, you can use trailing closure syntax.
//This can help make your code easier to read.
//
//Option 2: Closures don't work with dictionaries.
//Closures work fine with dictionaries.

//4️⃣
//✅Option 1: You can pass closures into functions as parameters.
//Closures act like integers, strings, or any other type.
//
//Option 2: Closures must only use variables declared inside them.
//They can also capture external values.
//5️⃣
//✅Option 1: Closures can return values.
//This statement is correct.
//
//Option 2: Swift provides shorthand parameter names like #0 and #1
//They are named $0 and $1.
//6️⃣
//✅Option 1: Closures can accept parameters.
//This statement is correct.
//
//Option 2: If any parameter to a function is a closure, you can use trailing closure syntax.
//You can use trailing closure syntax only if the final parameter is a closure.
